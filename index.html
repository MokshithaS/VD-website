   <pre>Keen on enjoying life
Coz we only live once 
Then what about working hard
Coz time waits for none 
Living with constant dilemma 
Of is it fine to have a little fun
Or am I gonna regret not starting now 

Lately I actually feel like I’m 18
Responsibilities pile up 
While my heart has lost all will 
to do anything whether I like it or not
Hobbies, I have none
Overthinking life maybe, if that counts

They say we’re too young to be stressed but
What do they really know
How many thoughts come spiralling
inside our little heads
when all that we desire is to be 
serene for at least once in a blue moon
It’s not a choice but an unspoken curse 
To think of everything that could possibly go wrong 

They say don’t overthink then
I wish it was that easy
Carried away by your own thoughts
 before you can even feel anything 
Trust me it’s not in my hands 
Only If I had a way to shut it off
I’ll do it as fast as the shooting stars
             ~Mokshitha</pre>

<div style="background-color:white;color:black;padding:20px;">

   <pre>Watch the world through my eyes
Isn’t it beautiful yet filled with lies
You think you are nice?
Then think twice 
Coz you will be the villain in someone’s life 

No matter how hard you work
Nobody is satisfied 
Let them say what they say
Coz you know nothing happens overnight 

World is beautiful yet filled with lies
They think you’re malicious if you be nice
You know you are genuine 
It doesn’t matter if they don’t believe it

You be you and ignore the people 
 who despise it
 no matter what you do
You’ll always be judged for something 

        ~Mokshitha</pre>

</td>
<td> 
<div style="background-color:white;color:black;padding:20px;">

    <pre>Think for a moment 
Before you let those words out of your mouth 
Think for a moment 
Will those words Pierce my heart 
Think for a moment 
Would those words tear me apart 
Not letting me close my eyes 
And keep me wondering if you meant it outright
 
Is that how you’ve been thinking about me
All this time
I try to ignore it but my mind won’t stop
Telling me, it was wrong 
You keep apologising 
You said it spontaneously 
But I believe it was a truth you hid underneath 

Now it makes me question everything 
Did I even know this person all this while?
Were all your words the truth or a mere lie?
Was I a fool or was I blind?
I’m done with playing small
You no longer a person in my life
         ~Mokshitha</pre>
